# GUESSING-GAME-

We used binary trees as are main data-structure and updates it dynamically to implement a guessing game in C++. 

The tree had nodes with attributes like a question and a “yes” or “no” answer to that question. The program would first initiate you to type in the object you want to guess , the question relating to it and the yes or no answer to the question.

The program will then try to guess the object based on your answers and in case of an  incorrect response the program would prompt you to type in another question-answer pair to get closer to the object and this updating the tree dynamically.
